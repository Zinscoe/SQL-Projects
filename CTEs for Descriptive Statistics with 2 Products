-- In the following --

-- I created a CTE named monthly_revs AS the following SELECT statement--
-- In the following SELECT statement, I pulled data with a date_trunc function that rounds the orderdate column
-- from the Subscriptions table to the 'month' of each date and named that column AS ordemmonth, and pulled the column productname
-- from the products table, and the Sum Function of the revenue column from the Subscriptions table named AS revenue
-- and these were pulled from the Subscription table named AS s and JOINed the Products table named AS p ON the column name of productid
-- from both the s table and the p table WHERE the orderdate column of the s table was BETWEEN the following dates '2022-01-01' AND '2022-12-31'
-- and the SELECT statement was GROUPED by the date_trunc() function, and the productname of the p table
with monthly_revs as (
 SELECT
  date_trunc('month', s.orderdate) AS ordermonth,
  p.productname,
  sum(s.revenue) AS revenue
 FROM
  subscription AS s
 JOIN
  products AS p
 ON s.productid = p.productid
 WHERE
  s.orderdate between '2022-01-01' and '2022-12-31'
 GROUP BY date_trunc('month', s.orderdate), p.productname
)

-- This SLECT statement gives us the Descriptive Statistics of the monthly_revs CTE
-- Such as the Min_Rev, Max_Rev, Avg_Rev, and Std_Dev_Rev
SELECT
  productname,
  min(revenue) AS min_rev,
  max(revenue) AS max_rev,
  avg(revenue) AS avg_rev,
  stddev(revenue) AS std_dev_rev
FROM
  monthly_revs
GROUP BY productname
